    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      This is a fully working clone for ESPNCricinfo mobile APP developed in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/ ">React
        Native
      </a>. Its a cross-platform app which works well for both <b>Android</b> and <b>IOS</b> and also having all the advanced features
      like Team and Series Search, Player Profiles, <b>fastcast</b> for blazingly fast scores updates, ball by ball commentary and
      many more. React Native is nothing but Native Components generated by JavaScript, so its much faster, smoother and
      gives better user experience than a conventional webview or a hybrid framework like PhoneGap, Xamarin. Choosing React
      Native over Native for mobile devlopment has lot of advantages which will be explained in further updates of docs .
    </p>

    <h3> Philosophy </h3>
    <p>This project was started in Jan-2018 with an aim to find a better
      replacement for webviews, but ended up developing a fully working clone of our Production ESPNCricinfo app.This is
      faster, smoother, lightweight and have webviews only for articles.</p>

        <br />
        React Native doesn't have inbuilt navigation modules, but community have some JS solutions, which are not smooth, so using React-Native-Navigation V1 which is a Native Package which supports both IOS and Android developed by Wix</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view#readme ">react-native-tab-view</a>
        <br />
        Tabbed Navigation is the trend today for both mobile and android, React Native community provides an excellent package for the same which uses Native View Pager for Android and ScrollView for IOS
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://code.espn.com/sunkus/react-native-video-player ">react-native-video-player</a>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios ">axios</a>
          <br />
          React Native has inbuilt Native polyfill for xhr and supports fetch, but for the sake of better handling used Axios

          <a href="http://mths.be/base64 ">base-64</a>

          <a href="https://github.com/thejameskyle/create-react-context#readme ">create-react-context</a>
          <br/>
          App Supports theming (as of now only dark and light themes) which needs config objects to be passed across the component hierarchy, to avoid that we've used a higher order component connected to react context.

        <p>
          <a href="http://redux.js.org ">redux</a>
          State Management is a much needed feature for complex screens like cricket GamePackage, mainly in an app user can open the same screen multiple times on the stack which needs multiple state copies if we go for component based state, so Redux comes in rescue where it maintains only one state object per UID thereby improving memory leakage issues.
